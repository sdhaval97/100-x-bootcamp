JAVASCRIPT
- web dev involves HTML, CSS and javascript code for front end
- browsers only understand html, css and javascript
- a combination of html, css, js and a bunch of images
- inside the browser, you will not be able to run c++, rust, go etc

Facts:
- React, NextJS are frameworks. they compile down to html css and js
- browser interprets html, css js and webassembly

PROPERTIES OF JS:
- interpreted language, which means it is executed line by line at run time
- dynamically types, which means that you dont have to declare the types of a variable
- Single threaded (red flag), which means that it can only run on one of your cpus. so, even if you have to go through a large set of inputs, only 1 cpu will be used
- garbage collection, done through garbage collector, which is pretty slow (memory management)
- Bun JS is creating faster runtime for javascript
